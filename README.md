# Optimising-Crop-Allocation-in-India-with-Mathematical-Approach-Mixed-Integer-Programming
## Abstract
This project aims to address the inefficiencies in India's agricultural sector by optimizing crop allocation through Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). With agriculture being a critical component of India's economy, enhancing agricultural efficiency is paramount. Our study focuses on reallocating eight key crops across 33 states to maximize agricultural profit while considering factors such as crop rotation benefits, land availability, labor costs, and environmental sustainability.
## Objectives
- To optimize the allocation of rice, wheat, maize, cotton, jute, horse gram, soybean, and potato across India's 33 states.
- To evaluate the impact of crop rotation on agricultural profitability and sustainability.
- To provide a mathematical model that aids in strategic agricultural planning and policy-making.
## Methodology
We utilize Mixed Integer Programming to develop two models: Model 1 (M1) ignores crop rotation benefits, while Model 2 (M2) incorporates them. These models consider various constraints, including land availability, crop demand, and environmental factors. The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is used for model formulation and Python for data visualization.
## Key Findings
- Our models demonstrate significant potential for improving agricultural profitability and productivity through optimized crop allocation.
- Incorporating crop rotation into planning results in an additional profit of 470 billion rupees, highlighting the economic benefits of sustainable practices.
- Sensitivity analysis reveals the model's responsiveness to changes in rotation benefits, underlining the importance of adaptability in agricultural strategies.
## Recommendations
- Policy Adjustments: Align agricultural policies and subsidies with model findings to encourage crop rotation and sustainable practices.
- Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Foster partnerships among experts in agriculture, soil science, climatology, and economics to refine and advance agricultural models.
## Limitations
The project acknowledges challenges such as technological access for farmers, water scarcity, and potential impacts on crop diversity. Addressing these limitations is essential for the comprehensive application of our findings.
